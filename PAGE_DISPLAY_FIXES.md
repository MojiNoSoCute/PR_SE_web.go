# Page Display Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Port Conflicts**: The development server was experiencing port conflicts and is now running on port 3009
2. **Component Rendering**: Some components may have JavaScript errors preventing proper display
3. **Data Provider**: The data provider is correctly falling back to sample data when Supabase is not configured
4. **Security Vulnerability**: Next.js had a critical security vulnerability that needed to be patched

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Configuration
- Updated Next.js to version 14.2.33 to fix critical security vulnerability
- The development server is now running on port 3009
- All pages should be accessible at http://localhost:3009/

### 2. Component Fixes
- Verified all components are properly structured
- Checked data flow from data provider to components
- Ensured proper error handling in components

### 3. Data Provider Improvements
- Enhanced fallback mechanism for sample data
- Added proper sorting for all data types
- Improved error handling when Supabase is not available

### 4. Security Updates
- Updated Next.js to version 14.2.33 to fix critical security vulnerability
- Ran npm audit to ensure no remaining vulnerabilities

## Pages That Should Display

1. **Home Page** - http://localhost:3009/
   - Shows announcements, faculty, publications, and student works

2. **Faculty Page** - http://localhost:3009/faculty
   - Lists all faculty members grouped by position

3. **Publications Page** - http://localhost:3009/publications
   - Shows all research publications with filtering options

4. **Student Works Page** - http://localhost:3009/student-works
   - Displays student projects and works

5. **Admin Pages** - http://localhost:3009/admin
   - Login: http://localhost:3009/admin/login
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:3009/admin (requires authentication)

## Troubleshooting Steps

If pages still don't display:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors in the browser's developer tools
2. **Verify Server Status**: Ensure the development server is running on port 3009
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh the page or clear browser cache
4. **Check Network Tab**: Verify all resources are loading correctly

## Admin Access

To access the admin panel:
1. Go to http://localhost:3009/admin/login
2. Use default credentials:
   - Email: admin@university.ac.th
   - Password: Admin123!
3. You should be redirected to the admin dashboard

## Development Notes

- The application uses sample data when Supabase is not configured
- All components have proper fallbacks for missing data
- Navigation links are properly implemented with Next.js routing
