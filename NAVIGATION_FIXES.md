# Navigation Fixes for Faculty and Publications

## Issues Identified

1. **Publications Sample Data Incomplete**: The sample data for publications was missing `doi` and `pdf_url` fields that are referenced in the publications detail page
2. **Faculty Navigation**: Verified that faculty navigation is working correctly

## Fixes Applied

1. **Enhanced Publications Sample Data**:
   - Added `doi` field to all publication samples
   - Added `pdf_url` field to all publication samples
   - This prevents errors when viewing publication detail pages

2. **Verified Faculty Components**:
   - Confirmed that faculty preview on homepage correctly links to `/faculty/[id]`
   - Verified that faculty listing page correctly links to detail pages
   - Confirmed that "ดูทั้งหมด" (View All) button correctly navigates to `/faculty`

## Testing

The navigation should now work correctly for both sections:

### Faculty Navigation
1. Homepage → Click "อาจารย์ประจำหลักสูตร" section → Faculty listing page (`/faculty`)
2. Homepage → Click individual faculty member in preview → Faculty detail page (`/faculty/[id]`)
3. Faculty listing page → Click any faculty member → Faculty detail page (`/faculty/[id]`)

### Publications Navigation
1. Homepage → Click "ผลงานวิจัยล่าสุด" section → Publications listing page (`/publications`)
2. Homepage → Click individual publication in preview → Publication detail page (`/publications/[id]`)
3. Publications listing page → Click any publication → Publication detail page (`/publications/[id]`)
