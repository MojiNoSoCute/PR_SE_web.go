# Supabase Error Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: The application was trying to create a Supabase client but missing the required `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables
2. **Direct Supabase Client Usage**: The faculty detail page was directly calling the Supabase client instead of using the data provider pattern
3. **Missing Data Provider Methods**: The data provider was missing methods to fetch faculty by ID and publications by author

## Fixes Applied

1. **Added Environment Files**:
   - Created `.env` file with empty Supabase configuration to prevent client creation errors
   - Created `.env.example` file to document required environment variables

2. **Enhanced Data Provider**:
   - Added `getFacultyById(id: string)` method to fetch a specific faculty member
   - Added `getPublicationsByAuthor(authorName: string)` method to fetch publications by author
   - Both methods support both Supabase and sample data fallbacks

3. **Updated Faculty Detail Page**:
   - Replaced direct Supabase client calls with data provider methods
   - Fixed type issues with map functions
   - Maintained the same functionality while using the proper data abstraction layer

## Files Modified

- `lib/data-provider.ts` - Added new methods for faculty and publications lookup
- `app/faculty/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated to use data provider instead of direct Supabase client
- `.env` - Added empty Supabase configuration to prevent client errors
- `.env.example` - Added example environment file for documentation

## Testing

The faculty detail page should now work correctly without Supabase errors:
1. Click on any faculty member from the homepage or faculty listing
2. The detail page should load with sample data
3. No Supabase client errors should appear

The application now properly handles the case where Supabase is not configured by falling back to sample data.
