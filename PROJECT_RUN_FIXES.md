# Project Run Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Running Processes**: Multiple Node.js processes were running, potentially locking files and preventing the project from starting properly
2. **Port Conflicts**: Previous instances of the development server were using ports, causing new instances to increment to different ports
3. **File Permissions**: The `.next` directory had permission issues that were preventing proper compilation
4. **Stale Build Files**: Previous build artifacts were causing conflicts

## Fixes Applied

1. **Terminated All Node.js Processes**: 
   - Used `taskkill /f /im node.exe` to terminate all running Node.js processes
   - This freed up any locked files and ports

2. **Cleaned Build Directory**:
   - Removed stale `.next` directory that had permission issues
   - Allowed Next.js to create a fresh build directory

3. **Restarted Development Server**:
   - Ran `npm run dev` to start the development server
   - Server is now successfully running on http://localhost:3000

## Verification

The project is now running successfully:
- Local URL: http://localhost:3000
- No errors in the console
- Ready status confirmed

## Prevention for Future

To avoid these issues in the future:
1. Always stop the development server properly with Ctrl+C
2. Check for running Node.js processes before starting the project
3. If encountering issues, terminate processes and clean the `.next` directory
4. Ensure proper file permissions on the project directory

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server
- `npm run build` - Builds the production version
- `npm run start` - Starts the production server
- `npm run lint` - Runs the linter
