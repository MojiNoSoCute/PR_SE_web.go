# Announcements Detail Page

This document describes the implementation of the announcements detail page feature.

## Feature Overview

Created a dedicated detail page for announcements that can be accessed by clicking the "อ่านเพิ่มเติม" (Read More) button in the news slider component.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Directory Structure
```
app/
  announcements/
    [id]/
      page.tsx          # Announcement detail page
```

### 2. Components Modified
- `components/news-slider.tsx` - Updated "อ่านเพิ่มเติม" button to link to detail page
- `app/announcements/[id]/page.tsx` - New announcement detail page

### 3. Features
- Dedicated detail page for each announcement
- Back navigation to homepage
- Display of announcement title, content, image, category, and publication date
- Responsive design consistent with other pages
- Data fallback mechanism (Supabase → Sample Data)

### 4. URL Structure
- Detail page: `/announcements/[id]`
- Example: `/announcements/1`

## Navigation Flow
1. User visits homepage
2. Sees announcements in news slider
3. Clicks "อ่านเพิ่มเติม" button
4. Navigates to `/announcements/[id]` detail page
5. Can return to homepage using back button

## Data Sources
The announcement detail page attempts to fetch data in this order:
1. Supabase database (if configured)
2. Sample data fallback (if Supabase unavailable)

This ensures the feature works in both development and production environments.
