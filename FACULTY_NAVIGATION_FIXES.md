# Faculty Navigation Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Faculty Detail Page Error**: The faculty detail page was trying to access a `department` field that doesn't exist in the sample data
2. **Navigation Issues**: When clicking on faculty members, the navigation might not be working properly

## Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Faculty Detail Page**:
   - Removed the department filter that was causing errors
   - Added a static department name instead of trying to access a non-existent field

2. **Verified Faculty Preview Component**:
   - Confirmed that the links are correctly structured
   - Verified that each faculty member links to `/faculty/[id]`

3. **Verified Faculty Page**:
   - Confirmed that the faculty listing page correctly displays all faculty members
   - Verified that each faculty member links to their detail page

## Testing

The faculty navigation should now work correctly:
1. Homepage → Click "อาจารย์ประจำหลักสูตร" button → Faculty listing page
2. Faculty listing page → Click any faculty member → Faculty detail page
3. Faculty preview on homepage → Click any faculty member → Faculty detail page

## Files Modified

- `app/faculty/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed department field access issue
